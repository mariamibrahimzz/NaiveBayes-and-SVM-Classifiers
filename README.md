# Naive Bayes and SVM Classifier Tutorials

This repository contains practical and educational notebooks demonstrating the use of **Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifiers. These are fundamental algorithms in machine learning, useful for classification tasks.

## 📁 Contents

- **`naive-bayes-classifier-in-python.ipynb`**  
  A step-by-step tutorial for building and evaluating a Naive Bayes classifier using Python and `scikit-learn`.

- **`svm-classifier-tutorial.ipynb`**  
  An educational walkthrough of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, including implementation and visualization.

- **`task-svm-titanic.ipynb`**  
  A hands-on project using SVM to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook
